# Pizza-app

## Explanation 
The purpose of this project is to combine lessons on Maven Web application workflows using the different levels of CRUD control.  To do this, I chose to take an old lesson on Bootstrap from CodeUp's curriculum and reworking it to include all the necessary functionality we achieve through the different integrated servlets, Java Server Pages (JSP), Java Beans, and Data Access Objects (DAOs).  This project also forces me to work through the IntelliJ Maven/?Web project configurations.
